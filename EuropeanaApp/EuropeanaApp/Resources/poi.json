That's the theme of Merry Go Round, the contribution of the Dutch artists Karel de Boer, Ward Kreykamp, Ivo Hulskamp and Stephan Schagen. It is a work of art everybody can identify with, just as everyone whirled around in an amusement park or a fair. The artists themselves want the work to be a message to Europe. According to them it's very healthy to float away from reality from time to time, to leave things as they are and then go on with your life.",

It is a transparent, deep blue, undulating space floating on the water.\nAt nightfall the work changes into a fluorescent jewel, says artist Anita Doornhein. The works dimensions are quite huge: 20 by 11 meters, needed to enable boats to pass trough this transparent wave.\nWhen a boat sails through the piece, sensors are activated, changing the colours of the Lightwave. Visitors see dynamically flowing hues in oxygenated blues, turquoises and silver. Images of water and air bubbles give you the feeling of sailing under water, or underneath an iceberg.' The artist hopes visitors will experience her work as opulent, luxuriant and enchanting.\nAt this point in time Lightwave is the crown on her work, because for the last ten years Doornhein has been occupied with the designs that, combined, form Lightwave: working with transparent materials, studying waves and currents and the play of light and reflection.",

It enables us to show all kinds of emotions to someone else, hoping that the other will understand us and react adequately. When you look sad, I am inclined to comfort you. When I laugh I invite you to join me in laughing. Communicating without using words. The two spectacular heads created by the Hungarian light artist Viktor Vicsek also show countless emotions and react to each other. Unlike people these Talking Heads don’t do it by means of muscles, but through all the possibibilities of light. Per head some 4000 individually controlable LEDs provide different facial expressions in various colours. As they are connected by Wi-Fi, they react to each other, but also to the interference of visitors. They conduct conversations by means of light. Only when a new boat passes, these talks are cut short, whereupon a new conversation between the heads commences. What is it exactly they’re saying to each other and to the visitors?  A word is enough to the wise, as the saying goes. We are curious what your facial expression will be watching this extraordinary project.",

It’s a phenomenon that has been astonishing people for thousands of years and inspired tribes who witnessed it to mythical stories. If you want to see it with your own eyes, you had best travel to the northernmost point of Sweden (like the Aurora Sky Station in Abisko national parc) or Norway. It may take patience though, because the northern light does not always show itself.\nIn Amsterdam we can now enjoy the northern light during the entire period of the festival, be it in the form of the work of art created by the Swedish light artist Alesksandra Stratimirovic. To this pioneer of light art (and author of the book You say Light I Think Shadow) the phenomenon of the northern light symbolizes friendship. By installing the already existing work in Amsterdam she hopes to convey this idea to the public. The breathtaking work extents itself across the canal and is programmed in such a way that an unpredictable curtain of light is created. Just like the real northern light this work will give you a magical experience.",
